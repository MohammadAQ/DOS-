# DOS-PROJECT
# Bazar - online book store
Bazar is an Online book store that works with microservices.
## Introduction 
The store will employ a two-tier web design - a front-end and a back- end - and use microservices at each tier. The front-end tier will accept user requests and perform initial processing. The backend consists of two components: a catalog server and an order server.

Where this store works with Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

    1. Highly maintainable and testable.
    2. Loosely coupled.
    3. Independently deployable.
    4. Organized around business capabilities.
    5. Owned by a small team.

First, make sure that you have **Python** installed on your device(s).

Next, make sure that you have **pip** if you don't have it on your device from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

On each virtual environment that works as a microservice is in its own folder. --> on CLI:  
```

For each machine, install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip3 install -r /path/to/microservice/folder/requirements.txt
